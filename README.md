# Yggdrasil-Project

The Yggdrasil project is an innovative initiative within the realm of computational chemistry, focusing on the application of machine learning techniques to predict organic chemical reactions. Named after the mythical Norse tree that connects the different worlds, Yggdrasil symbolizes the project's ambition to bridge the gap between traditional chemical theory and the cutting-edge field of artificial intelligence.

The project is structured around two main phases: Cognitio and Vaticinor. The Cognitio phase is dedicated to the meticulous preparation and processing of chemical reaction data, transforming the USPTO_MIT database into a format suitable for machine learning applications. This phase involves the integration of data from the USPTO database with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, enhancing the dataset with valuable computational insights necessary for accurate reaction prediction.

The Vaticinor phase represents the core of the Yggdrasil project, where the prepared dataset is utilized to design, develop, and validate a neural network model capable of predicting the outcomes of organic chemical reactions.
